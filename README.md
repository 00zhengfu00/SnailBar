Hi Guys! 
This 18 seconds long animation demonstrates cool progressbar in action. I created it at leisure. You can download the PSD here:

I called it Helixbar. It could've been a Snailbar, but I like Helixbar :) 
Hope you like it.

how to use ?
-------------------------------------------------------
in layout.xml
```xml
   <com.cjj.SnailBar
            android:id="@+id/seekBar"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            android:thumb="@anim/snailanim" />
```
Because SnailBar is a subclass of Seekbar, so you can use it like Seekbar
```java
  seekBar = (SeekBar) findViewById(R.id.seekBar);
  ```
